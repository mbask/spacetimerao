Title: Compute Rao's diversity index on numeric vectors and matrices
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: as.person("Marco Bascietto <marco.bascietto@crea.gov.it> [aut, cre]")
Description: Computes Rao's diversity index (Rao, 1982) on images, typically for remote sensing uses.
    The index is computed on numeric vectors and can be implemented spatially 
    on single-band images by moving windows, and temporally on single pixels 
    accross multi-band images. The package provides helper function to compute the 
    index on spatial or temporal raster stacks, serially or using cores in parallel. Rao, C. R. (1982). Diversity and 
    dissimilarity coefficients: a unified approach. Theoretical Population Biology, 21(1), 24â€“43.
