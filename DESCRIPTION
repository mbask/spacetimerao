Authors@R: as.person("Marco Bascietto <marco.bascietto@crea.gov.it> [aut, cre]")
Description: Computes Rao's diversity index on on images, typically for remote sensing uses.
    The index is computed on numeric vectors and can be implemented spatially 
    on single-band images by moving windows, and temporally on single pixels 
    accross multi-band images.
