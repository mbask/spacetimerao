Title: Compute Rao's diversity index on numeric vectors and matrices
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: as.person("Marco Bascietto <marco.bascietto@crea.gov.it> [aut, cre]")
Description: Computes Rao's diversity index (Rao, 1982) on images, typically for remote sensing uses.
    The index is computed on numeric vectors and can be implemented spatially 
    on single-band images by moving windows, and temporally on single pixels 
    accross multi-band images. Rao, C. R. (1982). Diversity and 
    dissimilarity coefficients: a unified approach. Theoretical Population Biology, 21(1), 24–43.
